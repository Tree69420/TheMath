# TheMath
A Calculator program that does virtually all math for you, great for school and mathcounts

Note: Conics and PlySmlt2 from the TI downloads thing are very helpful too, idk how to write apps

Transfer this directly to your TI-84 CE through TI-Connect CE, backwards compatability not guaranteed

Contains the quadratic formula, complete triangle solving, 3D volume, Trig, Prime factorization, pythagorean theorem, Summations, and Radical Simp

Credit for Radical Simp and Summations goes to github.com/brianzjk
